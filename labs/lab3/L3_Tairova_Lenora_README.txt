 *(a) What is the use of preventDefault ( )? - the default action of an event will be cancelled if this is added 
 *(this is possible if the actions is cancelable). 

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_preventdefault.asp) as shown below: 

```
Description
The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur.

For example, this can be useful when:

Clicking on a "Submit" button, prevent it from submitting a form
Clicking on a link, prevent the link from following the URL
